<h1>👨‍💻 Muhammad Thaifur Shahidan a.k.a th4ifurXI</h1>

I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Malaysia 🇲🇾. My journey into tech began with robotics in high school, where I explored LEGO EV3 and VEX kits 🤖. Although I enjoyed building robots, I found myself deeply interested in programming, which led me to pursue Computer Science. I'm constantly learning new technologies, building personal projects, and striving to become a software engineer who creates meaningful and user-focused applications. I’m passionate about backend development, full-stack web applications, cloud-based solutions ☁️, and system design.

### 🚀 Personal Projects

#### 🔹 [Drone Swarm Simulation](https://github.com/th4ifurXI/DroneSwarm)  
A Unity-based simulation of autonomous drones communicating within a swarm using custom algorithms and data structures. The project includes features like dynamic UI search, shortest-path calculations, and runtime performance analysis. Built for an Algorithms and Data Structures course, this project strengthened my understanding of graph traversal, partitioning logic, and UI-system integration within a real-time simulation.

#### 🔹 [iEmployee](https://github.com/th4ifurXI/iEmployee)  
A desktop CRUD application developed using Java, JavaFX, and MySQL, with phpMyAdmin used for database administration. Designed for an Object-Oriented Programming course, this system manages employee records through a user-friendly GUI. This project enhanced my skills in Java OOP design, event-driven programming, and backend integration for desktop apps.

#### 🔹 [YelpCamp](https://github.com/th4ifurXI/YelpCampDeploy)  
A full-stack web development project inspired by Yelp, built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS. The app features user authentication, CRUD operations, location mapping, and UI templating. It was developed as part of a web dev bootcamp and introduced me to backend frameworks, RESTful routing, and deployment on cloud platforms.
