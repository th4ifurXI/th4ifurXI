<h1>👨‍💻 Muhammad Thaifur Shahidan a.k.a th4ifurXI</h1>

I'm a 2nd Year Computer Science student at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP), Malaysia 🇲🇾.  
My journey into tech began with robotics in high school, where I explored LEGO EV3 and VEX kits 🤖.  
Although I enjoyed building robots, I found myself deeply interested in programming, which led me to pursue Computer Science.  
I'm constantly learning new technologies, building personal projects, and striving to become a software engineer who creates meaningful and user-focused applications.  
I’m passionate about backend development, full-stack web applications, cloud-based solutions ☁️, and system design.

### 🚀 Personal Projects

#### 🔹 [Drone Swarm Simulation](https://github.com/th4ifurXI/DroneSwarm)
A Unity-based simulation of autonomous drones communicating within a swarm using custom algorithms and data structures.  
The simulation features shortest-path finding, dynamic UI search, and performance benchmarking.  
Developed as a final project for the Algorithms and Data Structures course.

#### 🔹 [iEmployee](https://github.com/th4ifurXI/iEmployee)
a desktop CRUD application developed using Java, JavaFX, and MySQL with phpMyAdmin for database management. Built for an Object-Oriented Programming course, 
the system allows users to add, view, update, and delete employee records through a user-friendly graphical interface. 
This project enhanced my understanding of Java OOP concepts, GUI development, and database integration.

#### 🔹 [YelpCamp](https://github.com/th4ifurXI/YelpCampDeploy)
A full-stack web development project (bootcamp final) inspired by Yelp, using MongoDB, Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. 
Features include authentication, CRUD functionality, user reviews, and map integration. This was my first step into the web application development.
I learned from scratch how to develop, refactor, optimize, secure and deploy a web application.
